In what’s ominous, air quality dipping to “poor” category in Sep is a first in six years. As citizens of the national capital brace for the dreaded winter haze, Delhi govt has unveiled a 21-point action plan to curb pollution.\r\nThe action plan includes drone-monitoring of hotspots, special task force, work-from-home policy, voluntary vehicular restrictions, and a green award. To combat severe air pollution, the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme and even artificial rain are proposed.\r\n\r\nLast year, too, AAP govt had introduced a 15-point action plan, which was completely ineffective. In fact, the air pollution season of 2023-24 was one of the worst in recent memory, with an average AQI of 304, compared to 280 in 2022-23 and 278 in 2021-22.',3,''),(20,'gsdfgsdg','sdfgsdfgsdfgsdthgsdg',2,'uploads\\image-1727435380509.jpeg'),(663,'This is the first smart lock to support ultra-wideband','This Bolt Mission UWB Plus NFC is the first smart lock with ultra wideband technology, enabling secure, hands-free unlocking of your front door.',8,NULL),(664,'U.S. Proposes Ban on Connected Car Technology From China and Russia','The Commerce Department said hardware and software components in cars could allow foriegn adversaries to collect data on Americans and manipulate vehicles.',1,'https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/china-car-technology-ban.jpg'),(665,'Everything We Know About Lebanon’s Exploding Pagers','The old technology is used because it\'s more durable, reliable, and was thought to be more secure from attack.',1,'https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/GoldApolloPager.jpg'),(666,'Gizmodo Science Fair: A Quiet Supersonic Jet','NASA\'s Quesst mission seeks to validate a quiet supersonic technology, which could change FAA rules about flying faster than sound.',1,'https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/X-59-jet_r.jpg'),(667,'Endless Docs Await!
